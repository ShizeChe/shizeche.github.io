I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer and Information Science Department at University of Pennsylvania. I'm advised by [Prof. Gushu Li (Penn Quantum System Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/gushuli) and [Prof. Anthony Sigillito (Penn Quantum Hardware Lab)](https://www.pennqubit.com).

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Minor in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, during which I worked for [The Abstract Research Group](https://abstract.ece.cmu.edu).<br><br><br><br>

# Research
I'm broadly interested in quantum computer architecture. My work develops system and architectural support for electron spin qubits hosted in silicon quantum dot devices. My current effort spans device tuning automation, spin control, pulse-level compilation, and device simulation.
